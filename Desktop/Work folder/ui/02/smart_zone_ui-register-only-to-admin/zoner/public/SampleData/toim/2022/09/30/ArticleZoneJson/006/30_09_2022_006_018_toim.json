Structures falling in C1 category have to be vacated immediately. The hospital was shut down due to structural weaknesses, which was revealed in a civic audit in Augustend. A second audit was carried out by a private agency under BMC’s supervision. The report for the second audit, which was started on September 12, came on September 27. The findings will be presented to court on Monday. The 150bed hospital shut down its inpatient services, while the outpatient department, opposite the main building, are functional. The management went to court after some employees continued to admit patients and conduct tests.
