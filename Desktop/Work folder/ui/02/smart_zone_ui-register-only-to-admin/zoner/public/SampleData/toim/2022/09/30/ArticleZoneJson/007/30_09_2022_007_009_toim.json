    "ZoneText": " Mumbai:  Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Vineet Agarwal on Thursday said the nowbanned outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) had drawn up a plan to encourage its members to commit hate crimes and carry out targeted killings. <br> The Centre on Wednesday banned PFI and several of its associates for five years under a stringent antiterror law, accusing them of having “links” with global terror groups like the Islamic State. <br> Agarwal, an additional director general of police, said during its recent operation in Maharashtra, the ATS seized incriminating documents from people arrested for links with the PFI and one of the papers talked about the outfit’s ‘roadmap’ till 2047. According to the seized paper, members of the group were planning targeted killings as a part of their agenda, said the senior IPS officer, without elaborating further. The ATS is retrieving data from the gadgets confiscated from the accused persons to get an idea about the outfit’s activities, Agarwal said. The ATS is scrutinising bank accounts of PFI members and functionaries and will freeze them, he added. <br>PTI",
