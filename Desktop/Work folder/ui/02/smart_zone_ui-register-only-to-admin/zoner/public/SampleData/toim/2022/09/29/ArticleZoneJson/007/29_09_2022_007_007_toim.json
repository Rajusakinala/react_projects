    "ZoneText": " Mumbai: BJP secretary and former state minister Pankaja Munde recently called herself a symbol of dynastic politics and said even Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot finish her off politically if she rules in the hearts of people. She made the statement on September 17 at a programme held to mark Modi’s birthday.<br> As her remarks about Modi were highlighted by a section of media, Munde on Wednesday alleged “sensationalisation” of news with her party colleague and state minister Sudhir Mungantiwar saying her statement was taken out of context.<br> During the programme, Munde had said, “Modiji wants to end dynastic politics ... I am also a symbol of dynastic politics. But nobody can finish me off, not even Modiji, if  I rule in your (people’s) hearts.” <br> At the event, she urged children to keep a positive frame of mind and gave the example of Modi, saying he overcame all challenges in his childhood.<br>PTI",
