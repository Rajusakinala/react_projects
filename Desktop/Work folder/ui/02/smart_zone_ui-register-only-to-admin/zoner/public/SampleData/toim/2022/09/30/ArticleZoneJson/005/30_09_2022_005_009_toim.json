    "ZoneText": " Mumbai: In the ongoing daily merit round (DMR) for FYJC admissions in Mumbai, students will now not be allowed to reapply to colleges where they have not taken admissions after being allotted seats. <br> In the DMR introduced for the first time from September 26, students are allowed to fill forms from 7 pm to 8 am the next day. The merit list is announced every day at 10 am and students have to take admissions the same day. Students were allowed to fill forms in any college every day. As students are not taking admission in allotted colleges, the government has decided to not allow them to reapply to colleges where they were allotted seats in the DMR but did not take admissions. They can, however, continue to fill forms every day. The DMR will end on Friday and the merit list will be out on Saturday. As over 30,000 registered students have still not taken admission, the DMR is likely to be extended. So far, over 6,000 students have taken admission through the DMR. Over 76,000 FYJC seats are vacant. New students can register on 11thadmission.org.in and participate in the DMR. <br>TNN",
