Students from several colleges also gathered near Exam Bhavan to appeal to the university authorities.<br> Students from at least five city colleges wrote to MU seeking exam postponement as they claimed that they did not get adequate time and practice for a written test in the long-form pattern. They said they have given only online exams with multiplechoice questions for two years. An official said Karande has given assurance to the students and students’ organisation. A meeting will be held and a decision taken within four days, he said. TNN ",
